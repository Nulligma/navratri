      <p>
        Navratri Recipes, especially the Navratri Fast Recipes are not only
        quick to prepare, but also easy to digest. Hence, this festival is a
        good time to purify or detoxify your body and mind, and get connected to
        Durga Maa and your inner conscience, through the route of divinity.
