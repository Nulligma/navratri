      <h1>About Navratri Fasting</h1>
      <p>
        In India, fasting rules varies from community to community. It is always
        better to check with your family members and elders before deciding the
        menu.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here, I have shared some basic and some Navratri Special Recipes that
        are usually consumed during this festival. These Navratri Fast Recipes
        are usually quick and easy to make.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if you feel that some of the recipes have long procedures, you just
        have to follow them properly which makes the making of the dish quite
        simple. As onions, garlic and many other spices and herbs are not
        allowed during these fasting days, you really donâ€™t have to get yourself
        to chopping and prepping these.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keeping all these things in mind, I will also repeat once again that you
        must skip or alter the ingredients according the traditions followed in
        your own family. Most of the Navratri Fast Recipes in this curation are
        without onion and garlic, but some may have cereal flours.
      </p>
      <p>
        In such cases, you can substitute cornflour or gram flour with special
        vrat flours like water chestnut flour (singhare ka atta), buckwheat
        flour (kuttu ka atta), arrowroot flour or potato starch. Also, remember
        to use edible rock salt (sendha namak) in recipes where I have not added
        it.
