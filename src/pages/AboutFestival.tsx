      <h1>About Navratri Festival</h1>
      <p>
        Navratri is one of the most celebrated festivals at my home as well. As
        a devi bhakt myself, I not only spend these 9 days and nights offering
        my prayers in the worship of Maa Durga, but also observe the ritual of
        fasting. And it is not just during these 9 days, for me, not a single
        day goes without remembering the Mother Goddess.
      </p>
      <p>
        Navratri festival is celebrated with the same joy, enthusiasm and
        adoration all over India. Although, people belonging to different parts
        of the country have their own special way of paying homage to the divine
        powers of Goddess Durga.

        Another important feature of Navratri festival are the fasts or vrats
        that comes along. The Navratri Recipes that I have shared in this post
        are definitely a must try. If fasting, this complied list of Navratri
        Fast Recipes will be of great help to you.
